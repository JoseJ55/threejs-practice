# Three.js Practice

## Context
This is more practice for Three.js so I understand how other people make and utilize their models, and frames. Also adding the motion to the models and all the items on screen.

## Links
This practice is based on the youtube video by [Irradiance](https://www.youtube.com/@irradiance730). There is also the github he provided https://github.com/Domenicobrz/R3F-in-practice which help keep track of where the project was going.
